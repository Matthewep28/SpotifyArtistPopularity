# SpotifyArtistPopularity
Description
Analyzed Spotify and US Billboard 100 data to explore music trends, focusing on international artists, collaborations, and genre relevance. Using Spotify and Wikidata APIs, I examined how artist origin and song features influenced chart success. Linear and logarithmic regression analyses showed that popularity trends were more artist-driven than genre or regional factors. Key findings included signs of Latin America emerging as a growing market, a sharp decline in genre diversity since 1995, and a significant drop in the average song duration on the charts with the advent and growth of Spotify.
